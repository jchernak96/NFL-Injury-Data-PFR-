This repo is a collection of NFL Injury data scraped from PFR (Pro Football Reference). Note that these functions will return some errors but that is fine! Most errors are due to not having the "data tip" xpath which shows the specific injury (if they are not injured this will return an error but keep running). Also, be patient, these scrapes take a long time. I have uploaded the csv data of each season so you do not have to wait for the scraper. I also manually added in COVID 19 opt outs. Please let me know if you see any issues, I had to manually fix Cam Newton as PFR did not list him as out with COVID-19 in week 4. Also, some positions are missing due to some slight errors with the roster data. I am working on updating this.
